## 2. EDID Management

### What Is EDID?

EDID (Extended Display Identification Data) is what the KVM device sends to the target to describe its display capabilities — supported resolutions, refresh rates, vendor info. The KVM acts as a "fake monitor," so EDID determines what resolutions the target will output.

### Editing EDID Display Name

You can change the display name that the KVM device reports to the target. This name appears in the target OS display settings.

> **Note:** Only editing the display name is currently supported. Resolution editing and custom resolution entries are not yet available.

**Access:** Settings > EDID Display Name Editor (macOS) or Device > Update Display Settings (Qt)

### Use Cases

- **Identifying the display** in target OS settings
- **Custom naming** in multi-monitor setups to distinguish the KVM display

## 3. Macro System (macOS)

Macros are saved keyboard action sequences triggered from the toolbar macro panel.

### Key Sequence Format

**Modifier Tags:** `<CTRL>`, `<SHIFT>`, `<ALT>`, `<CMD>` (maps to Cmd/Win/Super depending on target OS)

**Special Keys:** `<ESC>`, `<BACK>`, `<ENTER>`, `<TAB>`, `<SPACE>`, `<LEFT>`, `<RIGHT>`, `<UP>`, `<DOWN>`, `<HOME>`, `<END>`, `<DEL>`, `<PGUP>`, `<PGDN>`, `<F1>`–`<F12>`

**Delays:** `<DELAY05s>`, `<DELAY1S>`, `<DELAY2S>`, `<DELAY5S>`, `<DELAY10S>`

### Examples

```
<CMD>c</CMD>              # Copy on macOS
<CTRL>c</CTRL>            # Copy on Windows
<DELAY05s><ENTER>         # Wait, then press Enter
```

### AI-Assisted Generation

The macro editor's **Magic** button generates macros from natural language. Describe what you want and the AI produces the key sequence.

### Verification

Mark macros as **verified** after testing. Only verified macros are available to the AI agent for autonomous execution.

```python
import socket
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.connect(("localhost", 12345))
sock.send(b"CHECK_STATUS\n")
print(sock.recv(4096).decode())
sock.close()
```

> **Security:** No authentication, encryption, or rate limiting. Only enable on trusted networks.

## iPadOS-Specific Features

### Bluetooth Connection Management

The iPadOS app connects to the KVM-Go dongle via **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** for keyboard/mouse HID input:

- **Auto-connect:** Enabled by default. On startup, the app scans for 5 seconds and auto-connects to the `kvm*` device with the strongest signal.
- **Reconnection:** If the connection drops, the app attempts to reconnect up to 3 times with a 2-second delay.
- **Signal monitoring:** RSSI updates every 2 seconds. The BLE button shows the signal strength (e.g., `-45 dBm`) with a color indicator: green (-50 to 0 dBm), orange (-70 to -50 dBm), red (below -70 dBm).
- **Device scanning:** Only devices whose name starts with `kvm` (case-insensitive) appear in the list.
- **Manual control:** Open the BLE screen to scan, connect, disconnect, or disable auto-connect.

### Info Overlay

Tap the **Info** button to display a real-time input status overlay in the top-right corner:

```
┌─ Input Status ────────┐
│ Mouse                 │
│ Mode: Absolute        │
│ Position: 512.0, 384.0│
│ Drag Mode: Active     │
│ Scrolling: Inactive   │
│ Keyboard              │
│ Mode: Normal          │
│ Caps Lock: OFF        │
│ Modifiers: Ctrl, Shift│
└───────────────────────┘
```

The overlay is transparent to touches — it doesn't block interaction with the video preview.

### Screen Orientation Correction

Tap the **Rotate** button to cycle through orientation correction modes: Normal, 90° CW, 180°, 90° CCW. This corrects the video preview when the KVM-Go dongle is mounted in a non-standard orientation. Rotation applies to both live preview and saved captures.

### Idle Timer Disabled

The app keeps the iPad screen **awake** during use by disabling the idle timer, preventing the iPad from auto-locking while monitoring the target PC.

### Logging System

The app includes a built-in `Logger` with category-based filtering:

| Category | Covers |
|---|---|
| `bluetooth` | BLE scanning, connection, data transmission |
| `mouse` | Mouse input, gesture detection, mode changes |
| `keyboard` | Key events, modifier state, composite keys |
| `camera` | Video recording, screenshots, photo capture |
| `ui` | Touch handling, gesture recognition, preview layer |
| `general` | App lifecycle, general info |

Logging can be adjusted in the app source to reduce console noise.

## Android-Specific Features

### Settings Panel

The Android app's settings panel (Menu button ☰) contains all configuration options:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Device** | Shows connected USB devices and status. Tap to select or re-scan. |
| **Disconnect Device** | Safely releases all USB connections. Use before unplugging. |
| **Baudrate** | Serial communication speed: **115200** (default) or **9600** (slower, for issues). |
| **Controls** | Camera brightness, contrast, and hue sliders. |
| **Video Format** | Resolution and frame rate selector. |
| **Rotate/Flip** | Rotate 90° CW/CCW, flip horizontally/vertically. |
| **Screen Capture / Record Video** | Screenshot and video recording. |
| **Relative / Absolute / Drag** | Switch mouse control mode. |
| **About Device** | Shows Android version and app version info. |

### Settings Persistence

The Android app remembers your preferences between sessions:

| Setting | Persisted? |
|---|---|
| Mouse control mode | Yes |
| Video format (resolution, FPS) | Yes |
| Camera parameters (brightness, contrast, hue) | Yes |
| Keyboard layout (US, JP, DE) | Yes |
| Baudrate | Yes |
| Device connection history | Yes |

When you reopen the app, it restores your last settings. To reset everything: Android Settings → Apps → Openterface → Storage → **Clear Data**.

### Safe Disconnect

Before unplugging the KVM device on Android:

1. Open the settings panel
2. Tap **Disconnect Device** (shown in red)
3. Wait for the app to release the USB connection
4. Unplug the cables

This prevents data corruption and ensures the target computer properly releases the keyboard/mouse.

### Android Performance Tips

- **Lower the resolution** — 640×480 is much lighter than 1920×1080
- **Reduce the frame rate** — 30fps uses less bandwidth than 60fps
- **Close other apps** — free up your phone's memory
- **Use a quality USB OTG adapter** — cheap adapters can bottleneck the connection
- The development team is working on reducing latency in the camera pipeline itself
