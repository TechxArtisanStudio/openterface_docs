## 1. Mouse Control

### Absolute Mode (Default)

The host mouse cursor maps directly to the target screen. Both cursors are visible.

- **Best for:** General use, server management, BIOS navigation
- **Cursor behavior:** Auto-hide or always show host cursor over the video area

### Relative (HID) Mode

Mouse movements are sent as relative deltas through the HID interface. The host cursor is hidden.

- **Best for:** Gaming, applications needing raw mouse input
- **Requirements:** Accessibility permission on macOS
- **Exit:** Global keyboard shortcut (macOS) or long-press Esc (Qt)

### Android Mouse Modes

The Android app offers three ways to control the target mouse, switchable in the settings panel:

| Mode | How It Works | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **Absolute (Default)** | Tap anywhere and the cursor jumps there and left-clicks. Position maps proportionally. | Most tasks |
| **Relative** | Drag your finger; cursor moves relative to your drag, like a laptop trackpad. Lift your finger and cursor stays put. | Fine cursor positioning |
| **Absolute Drag** | Tap and hold; cursor jumps and follows your finger. A "Drag" label appears. Release to drop. | Dragging files, selecting text |

**Mouse buttons on Android:** single tap = left-click, long press = right-click, double tap = double-click.

### iPadOS Mouse Modes

The iPadOS app offers two mouse modes, toggleable via the mouse mode button on the toolbar:

| Mode | Icon | How It Works | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pan Mode** (Relative) | Hand icon | Finger acts like a laptop trackpad — drag to move cursor, tap to click | General desktop use, flat surface |
| **iPencil Mode** (Absolute) | Pencil icon | Touch position maps directly to target screen coordinates, like a drawing tablet | Precise pointing, Apple Pencil use |

**Gestures in both modes:**

| Gesture | Pan Mode | iPencil Mode |
|---|---|---|
| **Single tap** | Left-click | Move cursor to point + left-click |
| **Tap & drag** | Move cursor (relative) | Drag with left button held |
| **Double-tap** | Double-click | Double-click at point |
| **Long press** | Right-click | Right-click at point |
| **Two-finger tap** | Right-click | Right-click |
| **Two-finger drag** | Scroll wheel | Scroll wheel |

**Quick Menu:** Long-press on the video preview to open a menu with Left Click, Right Click, and Drag options.

**Drag Mode:** Double-tap & hold or select Drag from the quick menu — the left button stays held, a "Dragging Mode Active" label appears.

### Performance Presets (macOS)

Under **Control > Mouse Mode > Performance Presets**:

| Preset | Throttle | Baudrate | Use Case |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Low Performance Target | 30 Hz | 9600 | Slow target devices |
| Casual Use | 80 Hz | 9600 | Everyday server management |
| Gaming | 250 Hz | 115200 | Responsive gaming |
| Max Performance | 1000 Hz | 115200 | Maximum responsiveness |

Higher throttle = more responsive. Higher baudrate = faster serial communication.

## 2. Keyboard Input

### Standard Input

All keystrokes typed while the app window is focused are forwarded to the target.

### Special Keys

Send key combinations via the toolbar keys panel or **Control > Special Keys**:

- **F1–F12:** Function keys
- **Ctrl+Alt+Del:** Windows three-finger salute
- **Print Screen:** Screenshot key
- **Ctrl+Alt+F2:** Linux VT switch

### Keyboard Layout

Set the target OS layout to match the target computer:

| Layout | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Windows** | Maps host keys to Windows conventions |
| **Mac** | Maps host keys to Mac conventions |
| **Linux** | Maps host keys to Linux conventions |

Regional layouts (QWERTY UK, Danish, QWERTZ German, AZERTY French, Japanese, etc.) are also available in the Qt application.

### Paste to Target

The app sends clipboard text as emulated keystrokes to the target. Useful for usernames, commands, URLs.

> **Note:** Only ASCII characters are supported. Long text may lose formatting or drop characters on older/busy systems.

**Configuring paste behavior (macOS):**
- **Ask Every Time:** Prompts host or target each time
- **Host Paste:** Always sends to target
- **Local Paste:** Always pastes on host

### Android On-Screen Keyboard

The Android app provides a full on-screen keyboard accessible via the keyboard button (⌨) at the bottom-right of the main screen:

| Control | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **ShortCut** | Pre-built shortcuts: Ctrl+C/V, Win+L, Ctrl+Alt+Del, Alt+F4, etc. |
| **Function** | F1–F12, PrtSc, ScrLk, navigation keys (Ins, Home, PgUp, etc.), arrows |
| **System** | QWERTY layout with letters, numbers, punctuation, Backspace, Enter |
| **Modifier keys** | Ctrl, Shift, Alt, Win — toggle buttons that auto-reset after the next key |

To send a combination like **Ctrl+Alt+Del**: tap Ctrl (highlights), tap Alt (both highlight), tap Del. All modifiers reset automatically after the key is sent.

The keyboard also supports **different regional layouts** (US, Japanese JIS, German QWERTZ, etc.) selectable in the settings panel. Zoom in/out buttons let you adjust key sizes.

### iPadOS Keyboard Input

The iPadOS app supports two keyboard input methods:

**Floating On-Screen Keyboard:** Tap the **Keyboard** button in the toolbar to show a draggable floating keyboard with a Mac-style layout:

| Row | Keys |
|---|---|
| **Top** | Esc, F1–F12, Del |
| **Number** | `, 1–0, -, =, Backspace |
| **QWERTY** | Tab, q–p, [, ], \, Enter |
| **Home row** | Caps, a–l, ;, ', Enter |
| **Bottom** | Shift, z–m, ,, ., /, Shift |
| **Modifiers** | Ctrl, Alt, Cmd, Space, Cmd, Alt, Ctrl |

- **Toggle modifiers:** Tap Ctrl, Shift, Alt, Cmd, or Caps to toggle on/off (highlighted in blue)
- **Keyboard modes:** Normal (standard typing) and Game (optimized HID packet header for game input)
- **Dragging:** Grab the drag handle in the header to reposition the keyboard anywhere on screen

**External iPad Keyboard:** Physical keyboards connected to the iPad (Bluetooth, Smart Connector, USB) are passed through directly to the target PC. Modifier keys send as press/release events, so combinations like `Ctrl+C` or `Alt+Tab` work naturally.

**Composite Key Shortcuts:** The app includes a library of common shortcuts accessible from the toolbar, organized by category:

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Navigation** | Ctrl+C/V/X/A/F, Ctrl+Home/End, Page Up/Down |
| **Editing** | Ctrl+Z/Y, Ctrl+B/I/U, Ctrl+D |
| **System** | Ctrl+S/O/P/R, F11, Alt+F4 |
| **Application** | Alt+Tab, Cmd+M, Cmd+Shift+3/4 (macOS screenshots) |
